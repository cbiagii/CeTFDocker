# Docker Image for pcitRif package in R

### Overview
This image provides a docker Rstudio interface for pcitRif package in R, pointing to [pcitRif repository](https://github.com/cbiagii/pcitRif).

The package provides the necessary instructions for performing the Partial Correlation coefficient with Information Theory (PCIT) from [Reverter and Chan 2008](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn482) and Regulatory Impact Factors (RIF) from [Reverter et al. 2010](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq051) algorithm. The PCIT algorithm identifies meaningful correlations to define edges in a weighted network. The algorithm can be applied to any correlation-based network including but not limited to gene co-expression networks. While the RIF algorithm identify critical transcript factors (TF) from gene expression data. These two algorithms when combined provide a very relevant layer of information for gene expression studies (Microarray, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data).
